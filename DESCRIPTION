Title: Finds RNASeq Source Tissues Using In Situ Hybridisation Data
Version: 0.1.3
Author: David Molnar
Maintainer: David Molnar <dmolnar100@icloud.com>
Description: Finds the most likely originating tissue(s) and developmental stage(s) of tissue-specific RNA sequencing data. The package identifies both pure transcriptomes and mixtures of transcriptomes. The most likely identity is found through comparisons of the sequencing data with high-throughput in situ hybridisation patterns. Typical uses are the identification of cancer cell origins, validation of cell culture strain identities, validation of single-cell transcriptomes, and validation of identity and purity of flow-sorting and dissection sequencing products.
